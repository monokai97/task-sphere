# Installation | Documentation - Payload CMS

## Software Requirements

Payload requires the following software:

- **Any JavaScript package manager**: `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn 2+` (`pnpm` is preferred, `yarn 1.x` is not supported).
- **Node.js**: version `20.9.0+`.
- **Next.js**: one of the following version ranges:
  - `15.2.9` - `15.2.x`
  - `15.3.9` - `15.3.x`
  - `15.4.11` - `15.4.x`
  - `16.2.6 +`
- **Any compatible database**: MongoDB, Postgres, or SQLite.

> ⚠️ **Important:** Before proceeding any further, please ensure that you have the above requirements met. Not all Next.js 15/16 releases are compatible — make sure you're using one of the supported version ranges listed above.

### Cache Components
While Next.js `cacheComponents` can be enabled alongside Payload without causing errors in the admin panel, full compatibility is not guaranteed.

---

## Quickstart with `create-payload-app`

To quickly scaffold a new Payload app in the fastest way possible, you can use `create-payload-app`. To do so, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-payload-app

```

Then just follow the prompts! You'll get set up with a new folder and a functioning Payload app inside. You can then start configuring your application.

---

## Adding to an existing app

Adding Payload to an existing Next.js app is super straightforward. You can either run the `npx create-payload-app` command inside your Next.js project's folder, or manually install Payload by following the steps below.

If you don't have a Next.js app already, but you still want to start a project from a blank Next.js app, you can create a new Next.js app using `npx create-next-app` and then follow the steps below.

### 1. Install the relevant packages

First, you'll want to add the required Payload packages to your project:

```bash
pnpm i payload @payloadcms/next

```

You'll also likely want to install the following optional packages:

* `@payloadcms/richtext-lexical` - Rich text editor (not needed if you don't use Rich Text).
* `sharp` - Image resizing, cropping, and focal point support (only needed if you use Upload collections with image manipulation).
* `graphql` - Only needed if you want to use the GraphQL API.

```bash
pnpm i @payloadcms/richtext-lexical sharp graphql

```

> 💡 **Note:** Swap out `pnpm` for your package manager. If you are using `npm`, you might need to install using legacy peer dependencies: `npm i --legacy-peer-deps`.

#### Install a Database Adapter

Payload requires a Database Adapter to establish a database connection. Payload works with all types of databases, but the most common are MongoDB and Postgres. Run one of the following commands:

**MongoDB Adapter:**

```bash
pnpm i @payloadcms/db-mongodb

```

**Postgres Adapter:**

```bash
pnpm i @payloadcms/db-postgres

```

**SQLite Adapter:**

```bash
pnpm i @payloadcms/db-sqlite

```

---

### 2. Copy Payload files into your Next.js app folder

Payload installs directly in your Next.js `/app` folder, and you'll need to place some files into that folder for Payload to run. You can copy these files from the Blank Template on GitHub.

Once you have the required Payload files in place in your `/app` folder, you should have something like this:

```text
app/
├─ (payload)/
│  └── // Payload files
├─ (my-app)/
│  └── // Your app files

```

The files that Payload needs to have in your `/app` folder do not regenerate and will never change. Once you slot them in, you never have to revisit them. They are not meant to be edited and simply import Payload dependencies from `@payloadcms/next` for the REST / GraphQL API and Admin Panel.

You can name the `(my-app)` folder anything you want. The name does not matter and will just be used to clarify your directory structure for yourself. Common names might be `(frontend)`, `(app)`, or similar.

---

### 3. Add the Payload Plugin to your Next.js config

Payload has a Next.js plugin that it uses to ensure compatibility with some of the packages Payload relies on, like `mongodb` or `drizzle-kit`. To add the Payload Plugin, use `withPayload` in your `next.config.js`:

```javascript
import { withPayload } from '@payloadcms/next/withPayload'

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Your Next.js config here.
}

// Make sure you wrap your `nextConfig` with the `withPayload` plugin.
export default withPayload(nextConfig)

```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Payload is a fully ESM project, and that means the `withPayload` function is an ECMAScript module.

To import the Payload Plugin, you need to make sure your `next.config` file is set up to use ESM. You can do this in one of two ways:

1. Set your own project to use ESM, by adding `"type": "module"` to your `package.json` file.
2. Give your Next.js config the `.mjs` file extension.

In either case, all `require`s and `export`s in your `next.config` file will need to be converted to `import` / `export` if they are not set up that way already.

---

### 4. Create a Payload Config and add it to your TypeScript config

Finally, you need to create a Payload Config. Generally, the Payload Config is located at the root of your repository, or next to your `/app` folder, and is named `payload.config.ts`.

Here's what Payload needs at a bare minimum:

```typescript
import sharp from 'sharp'
import { lexicalEditor } from '@payloadcms/richtext-lexical'
import { mongooseAdapter } from '@payloadcms/db-mongodb'
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'

export default buildConfig({
  // If you'd like to use Rich Text, pass your editor here.
  editor: lexicalEditor(),
  
  // Define and configure your collections in this array.
  collections: [],
  
  // Your Payload secret - should be a complex and secure string, unguessable.
  secret: process.env.PAYLOAD_SECRET || '',
  
  // Whichever Database Adapter you're using should go here.
  // Mongoose is shown as an example, but you can also use Postgres or SQLite.
  db: mongooseAdapter({
    url: process.env.DATABASE_URL || '',
  }),
  
  // If you want to resize images, crop, set focal point, etc.
  // This is optional - if you don't need to do these things, you don't need it!
  sharp,
})

```

Once you have a Payload Config, update your `tsconfig.json` to include a path that points to it:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "@payload-config": ["./payload.config.ts"]
    }
  }
}

```

---

### 5. Fire it up!

After you've reached this point, it's time to boot up Payload. Start your project in your application's folder to get going.

By default, the Next.js dev script is:

```bash
pnpm dev

```

*(or `npm run dev` if using npm).*

After it starts, you can go to **`http://localhost:3000/admin`** to create your first Payload user!

```
